# HealthDB
This project focuses on developing a database application to streamline and manage hospital operations and patient relations effectively. Leveraging MYSQL as the database management system, we plan to utilize a total of 7 entities: hospital, department, doctor, patient, person (utilized as IS-A), appointment, and medical record. The goal is to create a robust system that efficiently organizes and integrates information, enhancing the overall functionality of hospital workflows and improving patient care.
